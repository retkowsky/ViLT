# Visual Question Answering with ViLT

ViLT = Vision-and-Language Pre-training

The ViLT model was proposed in ViLT: Vision-and-Language Transformer Without Convolution or Region Supervision by Wonjae Kim, Bokyung Son, Ildoo Kim.
ViLT incorporates text embeddings into a Vision Transformer (ViT), allowing it to have a minimal design for Vision-and-Language Pre-training (VLP).
